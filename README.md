About This is a Web App that let you tune Hyperparameters and see what effects they have to your Machine Learning Model

The Web Optimization Model is a Python-based tool that uses machine learning algorithms to optimize web page performance and enhance user experience. This tool is designed to analyze web page data, identify performance bottlenecks, and suggest optimizations to improve web page load times and overall performance.
Installation:

Clone the repository from GitHub: [link to repository]
Install Python 3.x on your local machine if not already installed.
Install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file using pip or conda: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

Import the WebOptimizationModel module in your Python script.
Load your web page data into the model using the provided methods, such as load_data() or read_csv(), and preprocess the data as needed.
Train the model using the train_model() method, which applies various machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and identify performance bottlenecks.
Review the optimization suggestions provided by the model using the get_optimization_suggestions() method, which offers insights and recommendations for improving web page performance.
Implement the suggested optimizations on your web page, and evaluate the impact on web page load times and performance.
